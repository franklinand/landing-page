# landing-page
This project is a demonstration of my ability to style a webpage using CSS, specifically, Flexbox. This webpage is a mockup for a "Preppy Wardrobe Newsletter" that is completely satirical in nature. The theme was chosen simply out of my own amusement as a way of going above-and-beyond The Odin Project's requirements.
